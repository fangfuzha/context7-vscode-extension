# Context7 MCP Server for VS Code

This VS Code extension registers the [Context7](https://context7.com) MCP (Model Context Protocol) server with VS Code's built-in MCP support, giving AI assistants real-time access to up-to-date documentation for thousands of libraries and frameworks.

The extension connects to the hosted Context7 server at `https://mcp.context7.com/mcp`, so it is always running the latest version — no local server process, no manual updates.

## Features

- **Up-to-date Documentation**: Pulls version-specific documentation and code examples straight from the source into your AI assistant's context
- **Automatic Library Resolution**: Finds the right library documentation based on your query
- **Zero Configuration**: The server is registered automatically when the extension activates
- **Optional API Key**: Add a Context7 API key for higher rate limits and access to private repositories

## Installation

Install **Context7 MCP Server** from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Upstash.context7-mcp), or from the Extensions view in VS Code (`Upstash.context7-mcp`).

Requires VS Code 1.101 or later.

## Usage

Once installed, the Context7 MCP server is available to VS Code's AI features (e.g. Copilot Chat in agent mode). Ask questions like:

- "Show me how to use React hooks. use context7"
- "What are the best practices for Next.js routing? use context7"
- "How do I implement authentication with Supabase? use context7"

You can also reference a library directly by its Context7 ID:

```text
Implement basic authentication with Supabase. Use the API and documentation from the /supabase/supabase library.
```

> **Tip:** Add a rule to your AI assistant's instructions (e.g. `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) telling it to use Context7 for code generation and library questions, so you don't have to type `use context7` every time.

### Available Tools

1. **`resolve-library-id`** — Resolves a package/product name to a Context7-compatible library ID
2. **`get-library-docs`** — Fetches up-to-date documentation for a library

## Configuration

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `context7.apiKey` | Optional Context7 API key for higher rate limits and private repositories. Get one at [context7.com/dashboard](https://context7.com/dashboard). |

The API key takes effect immediately — no window reload required.
